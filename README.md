# TRACTION Pre Recorded Content Adaptation Tool

This repository contains the code of the Pre Recorded Content Adaptation Tool for the TRACTION EU-project, and it is used to select the appropriate bitrates during on-demand content streaming to guarantee viewers’ good QoE. It contains a Layout Monitor, a Bandwidth Predictor, a Playback Unit, a Quality Variation Monitor and a Bitrate Adaptation Unit. It tries to ensure the highest bitrate to audio, a key feature for performing arts pieces (opera in particular), since ensuring high audio quality can have a positive impact on viewers' QoE.
